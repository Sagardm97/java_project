## Introduction

This project provides Java implementations for common array operations and sorting algorithms. It's a resource for learning, practicing, and understanding fundamental concepts related to arrays and sorting in computer science.

## Array Operations

The `ArrayOperations.java` file includes various array operations, such as searching for an element, finding the maximum or minimum value, and more. These operations are useful for understanding how to work with arrays efficiently.

## Sorting Algorithms

The repository includes implementations of several sorting algorithms, including:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

You can explore the code for each sorting algorithm in their respective Java files. These algorithms provide valuable insights into different sorting techniques and their efficiency.
